*   Used to set the index for the automove, and set the decimal and steps equivalent 
*   for bit and distance calculations.    the first 10 values are linked to the automove
*   on the home screen, 11-72 are for calculating steps for 1/100th inch distances
*   
*   file structure
*           {finder, index, inch Fraction, inch decimal, steps}
*
*   steps are calulates at 0 microsteps, baseline.   microsteps calculations will be
*   done in the program.
*
*   the divider   (char(160)) is the small t special chacter

*   sets the section where the special bits and mid bit heights are stored.   The 
*   "bits" screen will use this section to read the distance from 0 to the center of
*   the bit.   That distance will then be used to off set to the center of the wood
*   being routed, as determined by the thickness field on the screen
*         (delimiter, index, name, inches, decimal, steps}
