*   used as the configuration file for the text in the error message boxes
*   instead of storing all the errors in the arduino memory, we can use the
*   file with the number codes to have the ErrorDialog function lookup the
*   error message, buttons and dynamically display them
*
*   second advantage--> the error messages can be dynamically configured in this
*   file instead of having to recompile the program code
*
*   embedded \r\n are designated with a Â©, which is char(169)
*   error Number, Error Title, Error Text, Button Yes, Button No, Yes Screen, No Screen
